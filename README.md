# TP_Arduino_Infrared

This code is linked to this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SR-IuzjXks
The Schematic is in the video as well

The code is about turning on a LED when pushing the '1' button on the remote and turning it off when pushing '2'.
It's just an example of how to deal with Infrared for the first time.
